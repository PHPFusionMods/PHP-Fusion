<td class='tbl2'><b>1. Introduction</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class='tbl1'>PHP-Fusion is a
light-weight open-source content management system (CMS) written in PHP. It utilises a
mySQL database to store your site content and includes a simple, comprehensive adminstration
system. PHP-Fusion includes the most common features you would expect to see in many other
CMS packages.

<p>PHP-Fusion is released under the terms and conditions of version 2 of the GNU
General Public License. For further information please visit
<a href='http://www.gnu.org/'>www.gnu.org</a> or refer to the gpl.txt file included in the
distribution package. You may alter the code in any way you wish and redistribute it either
as is or containing your own modifications. We would appreciate it if you retained the
"Powered by PHP-Fusion" footer copyright notice. We feel this is fair when you consider the
many hundreds of hours of work that continues to go into the development of this project.
However, if you do remove the footer copyright notice please consider making a donation
via Paypal.</td>

<td class='tbl2'><b>2. Installation</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class='tbl1'>Before installing PHP-Fusion you need to create a mysql database. You
can do this via your web-hosting control panel or phpMyAdmin. Make sure you have your
mysql access details at hand including the hostname, username, password and database
name as you will need to specify these during setup.

<p><b>1.</b> Before you upload the files, rename the file blank_config.php (located
in the folder entitled php-files) to config.php.

<p><b>2.</b> Upload the contents of the php-files folder to your web-server.

<p><b>3.</b> Unless you are running PHP-Fusion on a local server, in most cases you
will need to CHMOD the following files & folders to 777:

<ul style='list-style-type:disc'>
<li>administration/db_backups/</li>
<li>images/</li>
<li>images/imagelist.js</li>
<li>images/articles/</li>
<li>images/avatars/</li>
<li>images/news/</li>
<li>images/news_cats/</li>
<li>images/photoalbum/</li>
<li>images/photoalbum/submissions/</li>
<li>forum/attachments/</li>
<li>config.php</li>
</ul>

<p><b>4.</b> Goto your website, setup.php should start automatically, if it does not
appear you should run setup.php manually by entering your full site url followed by
/setup.php. Example: http://www.yourdomain.com/setup.php.

<p><b>5.</b> Complete the setup process by following all on-screen prompts.

<p><b>6.</b> Immediately after completing the installation of PHP-Fusion you must
CHMOD config.php back to 644 AND delete setup.php from your web-server.</td>

<td class='tbl2'><b>3. Upgrade from v6.00.1xx, v6.00.2xx or v6.00.3xx</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class='tbl1'>Before you upgrade we strongly recommend that you backup your
files and your database as PHP-Fusion 6.01 is a major update compared to its
predecessors. You need to follow these instructions precisely.

<p><b>1.</b> First you must upload the correct upgrade script from the folder
named 'upgrade v6.00.xxx' to the administration folder of your site.

<p><b>2.</b> Login to your site as the Super Administrator. Under the System
Admin tab of the Admin Panel, click on Upgrade then click the button marked
Upgrade. MAKE SURE the page reloads stating 'Database upgrade complete', failure
to do so may cause problems later on.

<p><b>3.</b> VERY IMPORTANT: Since this release contains a number of structural
changes, some elements of your site will not work properly until you have
updated all of your files. YOU MUST upload ALL of the files from the php-files
folder. Failing to upload all of the files will cause one or more of the
following problems: no admin access, lower-center and right side panels mixed up,
new gallery not working and more.

<p><b>4.</b> The photo gallery in v6.01 has been completely rewritten. We have
created an infusion called 'Photo Converter' which will import your albums and
photos into the new database tables. You should ONLY use the Photo Converter
Infusion AFTER completing the above steps. It is designed to run under specific
conditions which are created by the upgrade script and therefore will not work
prior to upgrading. Be sure to verify the new Photo Settings under System admin
before running the Photo Converter.

<p><b>5.</b> After completing the above steps, you need to chmod the folder
images/photoalbums/submissions to 777. You may also want to add a link under
System Admin -> Site Links entitled 'Submit Photo' with the url set to
'submit.php?stype=p'.

<p>If at all you are any doubt please feel free to ask one of our support
sites for help, there are plenty of knowledgeable users in our community
who can help or advise you regarding the upgrade process.</td>
